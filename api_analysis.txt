This RESTful API, built with Express.js, allows basic CRUD operations for managing a list of cars.

Endpoints:
- GET /cars          — Returns a list of all cars.
- GET /cars/:id      — Returns a single car by its ID.
- POST /cars         — Adds a new car using JSON request body.
- PUT /cars/:id      — Updates a car's details by ID.
- DELETE /cars/:id   — Deletes a car by ID.

The API stores car data in a local JSON file (cars.json). It uses unique ID generation via Date.now() and body-parsing middleware with express.json() to handle POST and PUT requests.

The design follows proper REST conventions, using path parameters rather than query strings. However, it lacks validation or error messaging for incomplete or malformed input.
